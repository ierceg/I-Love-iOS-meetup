# [fit] Swift design

#### June 2014

---

# [fit] NO CODE

---

# "Copland 2010"

* Infamous article on ArsTechnica by John Siracusa
* Revisited in 2010
* Objective-C's new lease of live with iOS

---

# Objective-C competitive advantages on iOS

* Language and runtime
* Compiled to machine code
* No garbage collection
* Easy and deterministic memory management

---

# By Apple for Apple

* Binary compatible with Objective-C
* Same runtime as Objective-C
* Automatic bridging to and from Objective-C
* Compiled to machine code and highly optimizable
* No garbage collection but built-in deterministic reference counting

---

# All around player

* Multiparadigmic
* Object oriented
* Strongly typed and generic
* Protocol-based
* Functional (1st class functions, closures and tuples)
* Excellent low-level facilities (e.g. overflow)

---

# Safe

* No explicit pointers
* 1st class optionals
* variables and constants
* `struct` vs `class`
* Many other improvements

---

# Expressive

* Typed inference
* Optional chaining
* Safer and far more expressive `switch`
* `enum` on steroids

---

# Easy to start with

* REPL
* Playgrounds

---

# Standard Library

* Very poor but expect significant grow
* `Array<T>` and `Dictionary<KeyType,ValueType>`
* `Equatable`, `Comparable`, `Hashable`, `Printable`
* Generic algorithms on top of protocols: `sort<>()`

---

## Issues

* Missing features (some coming soon)
    * Private, protected, public, maybe internal
* Many compiler defects (file bugs!)
* Many playground/REPL defects (file more bugs!)

---

## Learning

* Xcode 6 Beta 2 (of course)
* WWDC videos
* The Book
* I :heart: iOS talks :smile:
* Twitter: @swift
